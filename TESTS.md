# Testing your Solution

You will need to test your solution using two methods, manual testing and via a unit test. We will be using pytest for all Unit Tests as it integrates well with GitHub Classroom. Points will be awarded based on passing the unit test.

## Manual Testing

Before you submit your assignment to GitHub, make sure you run the example test cases below to verify you get the same result. Note, you can pass a manual test, but fail the unit test and vice versa so make sure you test it well using all methods.

## Example Case 1

The output shows the sequence of moves needed to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 3 disks.

### Case 1: Example Input

```text
3
```

### Case 1: Example Output

```text
Move disk 1 from peg A to peg C
Move disk 2 from peg A to peg B
Move disk 1 from peg C to peg B
Move disk 3 from peg A to peg C
Move disk 1 from peg B to peg A
Move disk 2 from peg B to peg C
Move disk 1 from peg A to peg C
Total moves: 7
```

## Example Case 2

The output shows the sequence of moves needed to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 7 disks.

### Case 2: Example Input

```text
7

## Execute the Unit Test in the Terminal

After pip and pytest are installed, you can run the command to execute all the tests. These are the same tests that GitHub Classroom uses so do not modify the test_main.py file:

* Linux / Unix: `pytest`
* Mac OS: `python3 -m pytest`
* Windows: `py -m pytest`

Note, your install may differ so you may need to research how to execute your pytest command.
